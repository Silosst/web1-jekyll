description: HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages. HTML uses a system of tags to mark up elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags provide a structure to the content, making it readable for web browsers. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduced several new features and elements that enhance the capabilities of web pages. It allows for native support of multimedia elements, semantic elements for better document structure, and the ability to create interactive web applications. HTML forms the foundation upon which the visual and interactive aspects of a website are built, working in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to deliver a rich user experience.
