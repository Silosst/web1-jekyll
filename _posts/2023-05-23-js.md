description: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is a fundamental component of modern web development, allowing developers to create responsive and interactive user experiences.  JavaScript is primarily used to manipulate and modify the content and behavior of web pages in real-time. It can access and modify the HTML and CSS of a page, respond to user interactions, and make requests to web servers to fetch and send data asynchronously. JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a versatile language for client-side scripting. With JavaScript, developers can create interactive features such as form validation, image sliders, interactive maps, and much more. It provides powerful APIs and libraries that simplify complex tasks and enable developers to build robust web applications. Furthermore, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side, thanks to technologies like Node.js. This allows for the development of full-stack applications, where JavaScript is used both on the front-end and back-end, providing a seamless and consistent programming environment.
