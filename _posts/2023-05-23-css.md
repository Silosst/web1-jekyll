description: Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS separates the content of a web page from its visual representation, allowing web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a website. CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. It provides a wide range of properties and values that determine how the elements should be displayed. CSS rules can be defined inline within an HTML document, within a <style> element in the <head> section, or in an external CSS file that is linked to the HTML document. One of the main advantages of CSS is its ability to apply styles consistently across multiple web pages. By defining styles in a central CSS file, changes made to the styles will automatically reflect on all the pages that reference it. This promotes maintainability and efficiency in web development.
